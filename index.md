title: Welcome to my first blog ever!

## Report

The blog has been made using Jekyll as framework, besides being the recommended framework on the tutorial, it has some key aspects:

- Is enabled on GitHub Pages.
- The homepage and other subpages can be made using Markdown.
- Is fairly easy to configurate.
- Shows good enough on multiple devices.
- I have created the webpage with minimal effort!

### First changes

- Create the homepage and first post with minimal information.
- Added more personal details.
- Small adjustments to check if webpage is launching succesfully.

### Second changes

- Cloned the repository on local machine.
- Modifying README file into a proper report.
- Deleted useless files that were from the tutorial (hoping to not break anything).
- Push changes on repository
